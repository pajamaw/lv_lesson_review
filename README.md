# lv_lesson_review
This is a rails app that uses omniauth via github, where you can review each learn verified lesson from 1-5 as well as comment on specifics. You'll have to login from your github account, and then you'll have access to all of your ratings and comments, which you can edit, as well as being able to see others.
